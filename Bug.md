# 🐛 Known Issues & Potential Bugs

1. **Service/Route: Path Duplication with Service Path**: When a Service is configured with a path (e.g., `http://mockserver:1080/mock`) and the Route path is `/`, a request to `http://localhost:8000/mock/hello` is forwarded to the upstream as `/mock/mock/hello`. This duplication occurs regardless of whether `strip_path` is enabled or disabled. (See `Bug\Bug1PathDuplicationwithServicePath/Bug1Service.json`, `Bug\Bug1PathDuplicationwithServicePath/Bug1Route.json`, `Bug\Bug1PathDuplicationwithServicePath/Bug1KongLog.txt`, `Bug\Bug1PathDuplicationwithServicePath/MockServerLog.png`)
2. **Service: Empty Service Name Display**: Service creation allows an empty name (defaulting to a GUID for identification), but the Service list displays it as a hyphen `"-"`, which is ambiguous.
3. **Service: Ambiguous Service Name**: It is possible to name a Service exactly `"-"`, making it indistinguishable from a Service with no name in the list view.
4. **Service: Unlimited Service Name Length**: There is no character limit on Service names, leading to UI layout issues. (See `Bug\Bug4UnlimitedServiceNameLength/LongName.png`)
5. **Route/Service: RTL Alignment Issue**: Arabic text does not align correctly from right to left. (See `Bug\Bug5RTLAlignmentIssue/ArabicAlign.png`)
6. **Route/Service: RTL Selection Issue**: Using Arabic characters in a Service Name causes selection/highlighting issues in the UI. (See `Bug\Bug6RTLSelectionIssue/ArabicSelection.png`)
7. **Route: Weak Route Path Validation**: The Route path validation does not strictly adhere to RFC 3986; for example, characters like `[]` in `/test[]` are incorrectly allowed.
8. **Route/Service: Inconsistent Validation UX**: Route Name validation triggers only on "Save", whereas Service Name validation triggers immediately on typing (input/blur).
9. **Service: Potential Infinite Loop**: It is possible to create a Service that points back to the Gateway's own endpoint. This needs investigation to determine if it causes a circular request loop.

10. **Service: Database Error Exposure in Client Certificate Validation**: When creating a Service with an invalid Client Certificate UUID (e.g., a UUID that doesn't reference an existing certificate entity), the system exposes raw database error messages to the user instead of providing a user-friendly validation error. The error message reads: "the foreign key '{id=\"a3f4c2e1-8b6d-4d9a-9f5a-1e7c2d8a4b91\"}' does not reference an existing 'certificates' entity." This reveals internal database structure and foreign key relationships, which is a security concern and provides poor user experience. The application should validate certificate references at the business logic layer before database operations and return appropriate user-friendly error messages. (See `Bug\Bug10DatabaseErrorExposureInClientCertValidation/DatabaseSchemaExposed.png`)
11. **Route: Route Name Special Character Validation Mismatch**: The Route Name field claims to only accept alphabets and 4 special characters (`.-_~`), but it actually accepts other special characters that should be rejected according to the displayed validation rules. (See `Bug\Bug11RouteNameSpecialCharacterValidationMismatch/SpecialCharaterName.png`)
12. **Route: Route Creation Allows Empty HTTP Methods**: When creating a Route, it is possible to save without selecting any HTTP methods. A Route without any HTTP methods is meaningless and will not match any incoming requests, yet the system allows its creation without validation or warning.
13. **Route: Route Creation Without Service Binding**: It is possible to create a Route without binding it to any Service. A Route without a Service association is not functional and cannot properly route traffic, yet the system allows its creation without validation or warning.
14. **Route: No Upper Limit for Priority Value**: The Route Priority field does not enforce an upper limit. Entering extremely large numbers results in an "unexpected error" rather than proper validation feedback. The system should define and validate a reasonable maximum priority value. (See `Bug\Bug14NoUpperLimitforPriorityValue/LargePriority.png`)
15. **Service: Missing TLS Parameters in Protocol/Host/Port/Path Mode**: When creating a Service using "protocol, host, port, path" mode, the Client certificate, CA certificates, and TLS verify parameters are not available. These parameters should be consistently available regardless of the configuration mode, as TLS settings are relevant in both modes.
16. **Service: No Inline Validation for Invalid Path Characters in Full URL**: When creating a Service using the "full URL" mode, if the path component contains invalid characters (e.g., unencoded spaces like `http://abc/path with spaces`), no immediate validation error or hint is displayed in the UI. The error only appears after attempting to submit the form, which provides poor user experience. (See `Bug\Bug16NoInlineValidationforInvalidPathCharactersinFullURL/PathWIthSpaceNoHint.png`)
16. **Service: Excessively Large Maximum Values for Retries and Timeouts**: The maximum allowed values for Retries (32767) and timeout parameters (2147483646ms, approximately 24.8 days) are extremely large and may not be practical for real-world use cases. These unrealistically high limits could lead to misconfiguration or unintended system behavior. Consider implementing more reasonable upper bounds with appropriate validation and user warnings.
